    <ul>
        <li>Bananas are berries but strawberries are not, botanically speaking.</li>
        <li>Sharks existed before trees – they’ve been around for over 400 million years. </li>
        <li>Octopuses have three hearts, and two of them stop beating when they swim.</li>
        <li>Honey never spoils – archaeologists found 3,000-year-old honey in Egyptian tombs that’s still edible.</li>
        <li>Your stomach gets a new lining every 3–4 days so it doesn’t digest itself.</li>
        <li>Sloths can hold their breath longer than dolphins – up to 40 minutes by slowing their heart rate.</li>

    </ul>
